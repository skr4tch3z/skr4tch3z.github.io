		<BR><BR>
		<p class="bodycopy">The small town of Parrish Springs is not ready for Matilda Honeycutt. A strange older woman with scraggly gray hair and jewelry that jangles as she walks, Matilda is certainly not the most likely person to buy the old Barton Building on the town's quaint main street. When it becomes apparent that her new shop doesn't fit the expectations of Parrish Springs residents, a brouhaha erupts. After all, Christmas is approaching, and the last thing the town needs is a junky shop run by someone who looks and acts like a gypsy. But as townsfolk venture into the strange store, they discover that old memories can bring new life and healing.

		<p class="quote">“Melody Carlson painted a serene and unforgettable sense of place that came alive with shimmering waters, one woman’s dream, life-changing wisdom, and characters I care about … I’m seriously hooked on the series!"</p>

		<p class="bodycopy">-- Kathy Herman, author of Secrets of Roux River Bayou Series and the Sophie Trace Trilogy</p>
		<br>
		<p class="quote">"Melody Carlson's River Song eased through me gently layer by layer, deeper and deeper. This story of re-awakening or renewal appears deceptively simple but wields great emotional power. I look forward to book 2 in The Inn at Shining Rivers series."</p>

		<p class="bodycopy">&#8211;Lyn Cote, Author of Her Abundant Joy</p>
		<br>
		<p class="quote">"In River’s Song, Melody Carlson beautifully tells a generational story of a family living alongside the banks of Oregon’s Siuslaw River. Told with sensitivity and insight the story includes a Native American thread, deals with issues of abuse, and weaves an ending full of redemption and grace. I can’t wait to read the next novel in the series!"</p>

		<p class="bodycopy">Life is heating up for the four Lindas-and it's not just hot flashes! Abby's losing sleep over her husband's health and neglecting her bed-and-breakfast dreams. Caroline may have waited too long to put her Alzheimer's-afflicted mom in a care facility. Marley's hard-won independence is threatened by her grown son's neediness. And Janie's having a hard time being everyone's rock as the relationship she counted on falters. Add to that a house fire, a missing set of dishes, a bully brother, plus a half-crazy blonde named Donna, and things get really complicated. But with each new twist their lives take, the Lindas are learning that good friends are the best family a girl can have.
