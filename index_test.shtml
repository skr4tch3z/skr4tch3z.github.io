        <blockquote>Tia D'Amico, a budding chef fresh out of culinary school, longs to leave her monotonous job at her family's restaurant in present-day Norton, Wash. She gets the chance when her aunt asks her to restore the restaurant aboard her aunt's luxury yacht to its former glory.  Tia moves to San Francisco with high hopes until she discovers that Leo Parker is to be the yacht's newly hired captain. As a teenager, Tia secretly admired Leo while on a summer sailing trip. With Tia learning her new job and Leo involved with someone else, their romance gets off to a stuttering start. Readers will enjoy following the lovely and decent Tia as she figures out the business and struggles with secrets, loyalties, and the tug of her heart. The secondary story involving Tia's aunt and her husband's severe medical condition provides some breathing room from the primary love story's march toward resolution. Tia's faith guides her decisions, but never in an overt way. Instead, good food, renewed love, and the clear ocean make this winsome romance a perfect and inspiring summer read.

        <p class="bodycopy">It's almost New Year's 1946, a perfect time for Caroline Marshall to start a new chapter in her life. Widowed three years ago when she lost her husband in the war, she has decided to move with her nine-year-old son to join her sister's family in sunny California. Her sister's new house has a basement apartment for Caroline to rent, and though jobs for women are scarce with so many veterans returning from the war, it seems the local chocolate factory is hiring. The apartment turns out to be rather dingy, and the job may be working the assembly line--a step down from Caroline's office job as a secretary back in Minnesota. But Caroline is determined to make a great new life for herself and her son. As she goes about making that happen, she keeps running into a handsome stranger--at the diner, at church, and he even works for M.G. Chocolates. With a New Year, a new home, and a new job, is Caroline ready to find new love?

          Miranda did not put adventure on her Christmas list, but thanks to her eighty-five-year-old neighbor Joy, that's exactly what she's getting this year. When Joy tells Miranda that she plans to drive an old RV decked out in Christmas decorations from their Chicago neighborhood to her new retirement digs in Phoenix&mdash;in the dead of winter, no less&mdash;the much younger Miranda insists that Joy cannot make such a trip by herself. Besides, a crazy trip with Joy would be more interesting than another Christmas home alone. Unemployed and facing foreclosure, Miranda feels she has nothing to lose by packing a bag and heading off to Route 66. But Joy has a hidden agenda for their Christmas joyride&mdash;and a hidden problem that could derail the whole venture.

While you're reading these words, it will happen to more than fifty people--and by the end of the day it will have happened to about 10,000. Maybe even someone you know. And yet most of us don't want to talk or even think about it. Death...it's unavoidable. So what happens after we leave this life? If you believe in Heaven, what do you expect to find there? What if there was a waiting room? A holding cell for people who aren't quite ready to pass through the pearly gates. And if there was a waiting room, who would be kept there? And why? This fictional story explores this with a touch of humor and a dose of reality.</p>

        <p class="bodycopy">Daphne Ballinger has learned to accept her deceased, eccentric aunt’s strange request that she marry in order to inherit her estate, along with taking over her aunt’s hometown paper’s advice column.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="bodycopy">But knowing and accepting that God’s will be done becomes harder when a new neighbor, a divorced socialite, learns of Daphne’s predicament and takes on the task of finding her the perfect man, even if it includes speed dating. When God does open Daphne’s heart, it is instead to take in a young girl left parentless and in the care of her dying grandmother. It may be a temporary arrangement until the girl’s uncle returns from the Marines, but God uses Daphne to speak His heavenly love and protection into the life of the child -- whom Daphne soon discovers has a very handsome and single uncle.</p>

      <p class="bodycopy">Megan Bernard would sell her soul to be prom queen. Okay, maybe not her soul. But her popular older sister Belinda was prom queen last year, and Megan is certain that the only thing that would make her truly happy would be to attain the same honor. Her mom thinks it would be pretty cool too. But when Megan decides she'll do whatever it takes to take home the crown, life gets decidedly complicated. Maybe "celebrity" isn't all it's cracked up to be after all.</p>
    </br>
      <p class="bodycopy">"Hard work by your friends and fairy-tale good luck can get you elected prom queen—if you want it badly
      enough. After catching a televangelist’s message to “believe it and receive it,” Megan decides that the
      prom crown will be hers. As part of her campaign during the months running up to prom, she tries to get
      involved in a range of extracurricular activities at her Christian high school, do good works, show
      leadership, lose weight, and get a date for the big night. While the teen guy characters don’t feel fully
      developed, here, Megan and her girlfriends are presented as credibly flawed and sympathetic, and readers
      will enjoy all of Megan’s projects to boost her electability, even if they occasionally stretch probability.
      There is no need for readers to refer to earlier episodes in the Life at Kingston High series for this entry to
      make sense to fans of very gentle Christian romances."
