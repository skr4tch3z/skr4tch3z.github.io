	<p class="bodycopy">As I mentioned in my newsletter, I get letters from readers who say: "I'm your biggest fan." Is that you???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="bodycopy">If so, you're in the right place. As I'm looking to this new year, I have some new ideas regarding my career. But they're the kind of ideas that need the help of a team--a DREAM TEAM! Actually, it's something I've been dreaming of...and something I hope just the right readers will be interested in. I believe everyone has different gifts and I'm hoping you'll want to partner with me with yours. So if you're interested in things like reading books...or talking about books...or praying for authors...or doing book reviews...or starting book clubs...or receiving free books to review...or a lot of other book related things, I hope you'll consider joining this team. To hear more about this idea, please, email me at <a href="mailto:melodycarlson@gmail.com">melodycarlsonbooks@gmail.com</a> and I'll send you a detailed letter explaining how the concept works. Thanks so much for your interest!</p>

	      I was recently honored in Chicago with the Romantic Times Career Achievement Award. Receiving this award made me stop and look back over my writing “career” and I found it hard to believe that I’ve been writing (professionally) for more than twenty years. How is that even possible? Before I got serious about writing I tended to flit from one “career” to the next. I never lasted at one thing for more than a few years. Although I learned a lot of interesting things in my diverse occupations, I could never find something I loved doing enough to imagine doing it for the rest of my life. However, I had always loved writing. I just never dreamed I could make a career of it. And even now—with more than 200 books published and more than five million books sold—I am more amazed than anyone. How did that happen?</P>

	<P class="bodycopy">One book at a time. Just like so many other things in life, one step at a time, one day at a time, this writing career happened one book at a time for me. And it continues to do so.</P>
	<BR>
	<P class="bodycopy">I’m the first one to admit that it’s amazing to do what you love for a living. And I feel very blessed that I can do that. But it’s only because of you (my readers) that I’m able to write as a livelihood. The connection we have—and I experience this connection regularly through the fabulous emails and letters I receive—is what really keeps me going. I love hearing your reactions to my stories and characters, and I so appreciate you taking the time to write to me. Thank you—thank you—thank you! On the same token, I want to thank every single one of you (even the ones who don’t write to me) for reading my books. That too is part of our connection. And I hope in the next twenty years that we will continue to stay connected.</P>
	<BR>
	<P class="bodycopy">I try to keep up with the emails and letters and facebook messages, but because I’m always working on a new book, it’s very easy to get behind. Like right now...I am way behind. But I hope you know that as I write new books, creating new characters with new problems, I am thinking of you and I’m hoping that I’m making something you’ll enjoy reading as much as I enjoy writing.</P>
