Newsletters and facebook and twitter, oh my! At the
moment, I feel a little overwhelmed with social networking and book
promotion etc.&#8212;like I&#8217;m barely keeping up. There&#8217;s so much to do
related to book publishing that I sometimes just scratch my head and
wonder&#8230;whatever happened to the good ol' days when a writer simply
wrote books?
</p>
<br>
<p class="bodycopy">
Yet at the same time, I realize we live in a new generation&#8212;the
connected generation&#8212;and because I really do care about my readers, I
do want to stay connected. And I love it when my readers write to me,
and I try to respond to as many letters as possible. Consequently, I
have to juggle my time between staying connected and continuing to
write books&#8230;and to hopefully still have a life.
</p>
<br>
<p class="bodycopy">
And then I remember that the mere process of writing stories is what
really connects me to my readers in the first place. So it would seem
that writing books should remain my top priority, right? Which is
probably why I use my writing as my favorite excuse for getting behind
in things like social networking and staying &#8220;connected.&#8221; Do I sound
conflicted? Well, duh&#8230;as one of my teen characters might say.
</p>
<br>
<p class="bodycopy">
So that brings me back to this whole idea of staying connected. Is it
possible that in this generation of hyper-connectivity that some of us
(okay, many of us) are over-connected? I wonder about those I see in
restaurants, people who appear to be out with loved ones, and yet they
seem distracted, checking their phones and texting. I also wonder about
families&#8230;where one parent excuses himself to &#8220;work&#8221; on his computer
while the others are still sitting around the table. Or a teen who is
unable hear what her mom is saying because she can&#8217;t peel her eyes off
of her iPhone. What is wrong with these pictures?
</p>
<br>
<p class="bodycopy">
What happens if our compulsion to remain &#8220;connected&#8221; ends up
disconnecting us? What if cell phones, computers, and e-tchnology just
separate us from the ones we really need to connect with? What happens
if our connectedness is really just an electronic form of social
isolation? What if our addiction to e-devices makes us unable to carry
on a real physical conversation with a loved one? What if it&#8217;s time to
disconnect a little? For me this is food for thought.
</p>
<br>
<p class="bodycopy">
Okay, this is my soapbox and I can jump on it if I want to...since this
is my website (insert chuckle here). But I&#8217;m really going to give this
connectivity thing some thought. And you might even hear me writing
about it in one of my books. Because that&#8217;s what I do&#8230;I write stories
to connect. But then I turn off my computer and exit my office and I
really do try to connect. Because otherwise I wouldn&#8217;t have much to
write about.
</p>
<br>
<p class="bodycopy">
So I wish you the best&#8230;and I wish you a little less e-connected...like
consider giving up texting in exchange for a face-to-face encounter.
Most of all I wish you a deep and lasting connection with the Great
Connector who longs to connect with all of us.

enough, right? Not this time. Cleo Neilson faces the chilling
consequences of her actions. Now she has a secret and can&#8217;t tell
anyone, and it&#8217;s breaking her heart. As Cleo fights through her grief
and guilt, she learns about faith in God and forgiveness through him.
As teenage girls read Cleo's journey, they too will learn the value of
having faith and receiving forgiveness as well as just how dangerous it
really is to keep a secret. </p>

fashion-focused TV show on location to Paris. </p>
      <p class="bodycopy">Unfortunately, it doesn't take long for many

right thing in tough situations---and the right thing for each
another---in a business that often encourages the worst? </p>
