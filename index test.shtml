When she gets home to Chicago, Rita finds her mother is healing but facing a long recovery. Worse, without being able to run their family-owned salon, her mother could lose the business. Rita decides to help, but she only has until Valentine's Day to come up with a plan. 
As Rita takes her mother's place at work, the nearby skating rink she loved as a child brings back fond memories. Rita also finds herself renewing friendships with her childhood best friend, Marley, as well as her classmate Johnny. Although they now lead such seemingly different lives, Rita is surprised by how well she and Johnny connect and how far he will go to help her. Though Rita believes Johnny is only being kind, with romance kindling in the air and on the ice, their friendship may just fall into something more. </p>

At age seventeen, Micah finally has the chance to meet her pen pal face-to-face. The only problem is that because of confusion about her name when the pen pals were assigned, her pen pal was a boy, Zack Miller. And all this time, Micah's never told Zack that she's actually a girl! While she wants nothing more than to experience life on Zack's Amish farm, she's afraid he'll hate her for deceiving him all these years. But she makes up her mind to face the music--and that's where the fun really begins.</p>

While you're reading these words, it will happen to more than fifty people--and by the end of the day it will have happened to about 10,000. Maybe even someone you know. And yet most of us don't want to talk or even think about it. Death...it's unavoidable. So what happens after we leave this life? If you believe in Heaven, what do you expect to find there? What if there was a waiting room? A holding cell for people who aren't quite ready to pass through the pearly gates. And if there was a waiting room, who would be kept there? And why?

It may be a temporary arrangement until the girl’s uncle returns from the Marines, but God uses Daphne to speak His heavenly love and protection into the life of the child -- whom Daphne soon discovers has a very handsome and single uncle.</p>

      <p class="subhead" align="center">Prom Queen</p>
      <BR>
      <p class="bodycopy">Megan Bernard would sell her soul to be prom queen. Okay, maybe not her soul. But her popular older sister Belinda was prom queen last year, and Megan is certain that the only thing that would make her truly happy would be to attain the same honor. Her mom thinks it would be pretty cool too. But when Megan decides she'll do whatever it takes to take home the crown, life gets decidedly complicated. Maybe "celebrity" isn't all it's cracked up to be after all.</p>
    </br>
      <p class="bodycopy">"Hard work by your friends and fairy-tale good luck can get you elected prom queen—if you want it badly
      enough. After catching a televangelist’s message to “believe it and receive it,” Megan decides that the
      prom crown will be hers. As part of her campaign during the months running up to prom, she tries to get
      involved in a range of extracurricular activities at her Christian high school, do good works, show
      leadership, lose weight, and get a date for the big night. While the teen guy characters don’t feel fully
      developed, here, Megan and her girlfriends are presented as credibly flawed and sympathetic, and readers
      will enjoy all of Megan’s projects to boost her electability, even if they occasionally stretch probability.
      There is no need for readers to refer to earlier episodes in the Life at Kingston High series for this entry to
      make sense to fans of very gentle Christian romances."

			<BR>
			<p class="bodycopy">Eight-year-old Lucy Turnbull knew better than to wish for a pony that Christmas in 1937. Her mother had assured her in no uncertain terms that asking for a pony was the same as asking for the moon. Besides, the only extra mouths they needed at their boarding house were the paying kind. But when an interesting pair of strangers comes to town, Lucy starts to believe her Christmas wishes might just come true after all.</p>

			<BR>
			<p class="bodycopy">In Healing Waters—the first study in the new Faith and Fiction Bible study series—popular Christian fiction author Melody Carlson draws upon her novels in The Inn at Shining Waters trilogy to invite women on an exciting journey toward healing. Using the stories, themes, and characters of the novels as a backdrop, this eight-week study explores the need for forgiveness and mercy in one's life and the role that second chances and new beginnings play in healing women's spirits and relationships.</p>
			<BR>
			<p class="bodycopy"> The Participant Book is an all-inclusive guide providing summaries of the three novels—River’s Song, River’s Call, and River’s End—character sketches of the main characters, excerpts from the novels, and five daily Bible study readings for each week. Each day’s reading includes reflection questions with space for recording responses, a short prayer, and an “As You Go” idea or suggestion. Although reading the novels is not required to participate in the study, women may choose to read the novels in tandem with the study to enrich the overall experience.</p>
