This is a no-brainer recipe I made up to be quick and easy.

Way Easy Baked Yam and Apple Dish
<P class="bodycopy">
1 can of yams (I think it&#8217;s a #2 can)
</P>
2-3 apples (baking type apples like Fuji or Rome)
</P>
&#189; cup chopped walnuts (or pecans if you like)
</P>
&#189; cup brown sugar
</P>
&#189; stick butter
</P>
1 tsp cinnamon
</P>
&#189; tsp nutmeg
</P>
&#189; tsp salt
<P class="bodycopy">
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
Use nonstick spray (or butter) to grease 9&#8221; sq. baking dish. Drain yams and place on bottom of dish. Cut apples width-wise to create apple circles (then use a paring knife to remove the seed &#8220;star&#8221; so the apples look like donuts) and place on top of yams. Sprinkle seasonings evenly over yams/apples. Then place slices of butter equally over the top. Sprinkle brown sugar and walnuts on top. Cover loosely with foil and bake for about thirty minutes (a little longer doesn&#8217;t hurt.) Remove foil for last few minutes to crisp the top. Or not. This serves 4-6 people and is easy to double. You could top with marshmallows if you want, but my family doesn&#8217;t like them.
